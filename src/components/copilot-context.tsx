            Navigate to a page to perform an operation. Use this if you are asked to perform an action outside of page context. For example:
            The user is viewing a dashboard but asks to make changes to a team member or a credit card.
            
            If you are on the cards page for example, and are requested to perform a card related operation, you are allowed to perform it.
            
            If the operation is unavailable, tell the user to navigate themselves to the page.
            Let them know which page that is.
            Advise them to re-ask co-pilot once they arrive at the right page.
            You can suggest making the navigation part yourself
            Example: "Adding new card is not available in this page. Navigate to "Cards" page and try to ask me again there. Would you like me to take you there?"
